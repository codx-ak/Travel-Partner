        <h3>What is Travel Insurance?</h3>
    <p>travel insurance policy is a versatile plan that offers financial compensation for a range of emergencies
        faced by the policyholder on a trip. It is a very effective way to secure any trip, given that you compare
        travel insurance plans before buying the best one for your upcoming trip.</p>
    <p>Usually, people only learn about travel insurance when they need to visit a country which requires them to
        buy international travel insurance online. However, compared to pre-pandemic times, more travellers are now
        insuring their trips.</p>
